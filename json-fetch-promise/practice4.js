/* 
* HTTP methods (or verbs) are used to specify the type of action the client wants to perform on a given resource when interacting with a web server. 
* The most common HTTP methods are: GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE.
* GET: Retrieves data from a server.
* POST: Sends data to the server to create a new resource.
* PATCH: Partially updates a resource, meaning it only modifies certain fields rather than replacing the entire resource.
* PUT: Updates an existing resource or creates a new one if it doesnâ€™t exist.
* DELETE: Deletes a resource from the server.
