// #1
/* 
* If we call a function inside synchronous code, JavaScript will execute the function after completing the previous code execution (if any). 
* The function's output will be displayed, and then the next code will be executed sequentially.
*/


// #2
/* 
* JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language by nature. 
* This means that JavaScript will execute the code line by line, maintaining a sequential order.
