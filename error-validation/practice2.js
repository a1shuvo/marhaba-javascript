/* 
* Different types of Error in JavaScript:
* Syntax Error
* TypeError
* Reference Error
* Logical Error
* Range Error
*/ 


// #1
/* 
* No semicolon usually doesn't cause an immediate error due to Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI).
* But it can result in unexpected behavior or logical issues.
* Syntax errors can happen when the absence of semicolons leads to ambigu ities in the code. 
*/


// #2
/* 
* A reference error occurs when JavaScript encounters a variable that has not been declared.
* Trying to access a variable that hasn't been initialized or declared in the current scope.
*/


// #3
/* 
* Differce between Syntax Error and Type Error:
* Syntax errors happen when we write invalid JavaScript code. For example: missing parentheses, incorrect use of keywords, or unbalanced curly braces.
* Type errors happen when we try to invoke a method or perform an operation on a value that doesn't support that operation, such as calling a string method on a number.
* Occurs when JavaScript can't parse or read the code because of invalid structure or grammar in the code.
* Occurs when we try to do something with the wrong data type or performing an operation on an incompatible data type.
